# ETL-Pipeline-for-Healthcare-Data
Built an ETL pipeline to integrate various healthcare datasets, enhancing data accessibility and analysis efficiency. 

Skills: SQL, Python, AWS

Tools and Frameworks:

ETL Framework: Apache Airflow, Apache NiFi
Data Processing: Python (Pandas), Spark
Database: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB)
Cloud Platforms: AWS (Glue, Redshift), Google Cloud (Dataflow, BigQuery), Azure (Data Factory)
Plan:

Requirements Gathering:

Identify data sources, data formats, and integration requirements.
Define the ETL process scope and objectives.
Data Source Analysis:

Evaluate the structure and quality of data from EHRs, medical devices, and external health databases.
ETL Pipeline Design:

Architecture: Design the overall architecture of the ETL pipeline.
Workflow Management: Use Apache Airflow for orchestrating the ETL processes.
Data Extraction:

Extract data from various sources using Python scripts, SQL queries, or API calls.
Use Apache NiFi for handling real-time data streams if necessary.
Data Transformation:

Clean and preprocess data using Pandas or Spark.
Apply necessary transformations like normalization, aggregation, and filtering.
Data Loading:

Load transformed data into the target data warehouse (AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Azure SQL Database).
Automation and Scheduling:

Schedule ETL jobs using Apache Airflow to ensure regular updates.
Set up monitoring and alerts for ETL job failures.
Testing and Validation:

Validate the integrity and accuracy of the data at each stage.
Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle expected data volumes.
Documentation and Training:

Document the ETL processes, code, and configuration.
Provide training to team members on maintaining and extending the ETL pipeline.
